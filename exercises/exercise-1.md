# Exercise 1 - git-it interactive tutorial

Git-it is a desktop (Mac, Windows and Linux) app that teaches you how to use Git and GitHub on the command line.

## In this exercise we will
- Learn git basics using Git-it

## 1.1 Getting started with Git-it

:pencil2: To follow this exercise, you will need Git-it [Download Git-it here](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron/releases) and get started!
If you do not want to download this, or you are not able to make it work - [you can see all the questions tasks here](http://jlord.us/git-it/). However, you will not be able to have `git-it` validate your work.

Git-it has several exercises included, not just the first one where you install Git. Remember to click "Verify" after each step to make sure you got everything right.

:bulb: The verify button at the end of each step might not work correctly. You can try run git-it as administrator, but it's not a big issue. If you're confident you've solved the task just move on, or ask an instructor in the room to verify.
